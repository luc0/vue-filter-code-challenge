Enhancements that it would be nice to have, and it's not included in this deliverable:
- Run the code in a server so we can import json, axios and set configs.
- UX: set focus on input value, when click on comparison type.
- Retrieve some results to check visually that it's working. But if you check in networks, you can see is POSTING OK.
- Better UI (radio buttons, fonts, normalize spaces, and use sass for better organization of styles)
